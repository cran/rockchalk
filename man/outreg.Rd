\title{Creates a publication quality result table for
regression models. Works with models fitted with lm, glm, as well
as lme4.}

outreg(
  modelList,
  type = "latex",
  modelLabels = NULL,
  varLabels = NULL,
  tight = TRUE,
  centering = c("none", "siunitx", "dcolumn"),

}
\arguments{
\item{modelList}{A regression model or an R list of regression
models. Default model names will be M1, M2, and so forth. User
specified names are allowed, such as \code{list("My Model" =
m1, "Her Model" = m2)}.  This is the currently recommended way
to supply model lables. This is less error prone than the use
of the modelLabels argument.}

\item{type}{Default = "latex". The alternatives are "html" and
"csv"}

\item{modelLabels}{This is allowed, but discouraged. A vector of
character string variables, one for each element in
modelList. Will override the names in modelList.}

\item{varLabels}{To beautify the parameter names printed.  Must be
a named vector in the format c(parmname = "displayName",
parmname = "displayName"). Include as many parameters as
desired, it is not necessary to supply new labels for all of
the parameters.}

\item{tight}{Table format. If TRUE, parameter estimates and
standard errors are printed in a single column.  If FALSE,
parameter estimates and standard errors are printed side by
side.}

\item{centering}{Default is "none", but may be "siunitx" or
"dcolumn". No centering has been the only way until this
version. User feedback requested.  Don't forget to insert
usepackage statment in document preamble for siunitx or
dcolumn. If user specifies \code{centering=TRUE}, the
\code{siunitx} method will be used. The \code{dcolumn}
approach assumes that the values reported in the column use
fewer than 3 integer places and 3 decimal places. Additional
room is allocated for the significance stars.}

\item{showAIC}{This is a legacy argument, before the
\code{request} argument was created.  If TRUE, the AIC
estimate is included with the diagnostic values. It has the
same effect as described by \code{request}.}

\item{float}{Default = FALSE. Include boilerplate for a LaTeX
table float, with the tabular markup inside it. Not relevant
if type = "html".}

\item{request}{Extra information to be retrieved from the
summary(model) and displayed. This must be a vector of named
arguments, such as c(adj.r.squared = "adj $R^2$", fstatistic =
"F"). The name must be a valid name of the output object, the
value should be the label the user wants printed in the
table. See details.}

\item{runFuns}{A list of functions}

\item{digits}{Default = 3. How many digits after decimal sign are
to be displayed.}

\item{alpha}{Default = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001). I think stars are
dumb, but enough people have asked me for more stars that I'm
caving in.}

\item{SElist}{Optional. Replacement standard errors. Must be a
list of named vectors. \code{outreg} uses the R \code{summary}
to retrieve standard errors, but one might instead want to use
robust or bootstrapped standard errors.  This argument may
supply a new SE vector for each fitted regression model, but
it is also allowed to supply the SE replacement for just one
of the models. The format should be \code{list("A Model Label"
= c(0.1, 0.3, 0.4), "Another Model Label" = c(0.4, 0.2, 0.3)}.
On the left, one must use the same names that are used in the
modelList argument.}

\item{PVlist}{Optional. A list of replacement "p values". It must
be a list of named vectors, similar in format to SElist. The
which the elements are the "p values" that the user wants to
use for each model.}

\item{Blist}{Optional. This is only needed in the rare case where
a model's parameters cannot be discerned from its
summary. List must have names for models, and vectors slope
coefficient. See discussion of SElist and PVlist.}

\item{title}{A LaTeX caption for the table. Not relevant if type =
"html".}

\item{label}{A string to be used as a LaTeX label in the table to
be created. Not relevant if type = "html".}

\item{gofNames}{Optional pretty names. R regression summaries use
names like "sigma" or "r.squared" that we might want to revise
for presentation. I prefer to refer to "sigma" as "RMSE", but
perhaps you instead prefer something like \code{gofnames =
c("sigma" = "That Estimate I don't understand", "deviance" =
"Another Mystery")}. The words that you might replace are
"sigma", "r.squared", "deviance", "adj.r.squared",
"fstatistic".}

\item{print.results}{Default TRUE, marked-up table will be
displayed in session.  If FALSE, same result is returned as an
object.}

\item{browse}{Display the regression model in a browse? Defaults
to TRUE if type = "html"}
}
\value{
A character vector, one element per row of the regression
    table.

\description{
This provides "markup" that the user is will copy into a LaTeX
document. As of rockchalk 1.8.4, can also create HTML markup.

\details{
\code{outreg} returns a string vector. It is suggested that users
should save the outreg result and then use cat to save it. That is
myMod <- outreg(m1, ...)  cat(myMod, file = "myMod.html") or
cat(myMod, file = "myMod.tex".  In version 1.8.66, we write the
html file to a temporary location and display it in a web
browser. Many word processors will not accept a cut-and paste
transfer from the browser, they will, however, be able to open the
html file itself and automatically re-format it in the native
table format.

In version 1.8.111, an argument \code{print.results} was introduced.
This is TRUE by default, so the marked-up table is printed into
the session, and it is returned as well.  If the function should
run silently (as suggested in the last few versions), include
\code{print.results = TRUE}. 

The table includes a minimally sufficient (in my opinion) model
summary.  It offers parameter estimates, standard errors, and
minimally sufficient goodness of fit.  My tastes tend toward
minimal tables, but users request more features, and
\code{outreg}'s interface hass been generalized to allow
specialized requests. See \code{request} and \code{runFuns}
arguments.

I don't want to write a separate table function for every
different kind of regression model that exists (how
exhausting). So I've tried to revise \code{outreg()} to work with
regression functions that follow the standard R framework. It is
known to work \code{lm} and \code{glm}, as well as \code{merMod}
class from \code{lme4}, but it will try to interact with other
kinds of regression models.  Those models should have methods
\code{summary()}, \code{coef()}, \code{vcov()} and \code{nobs()}.
Package writes should provide those, its not my job.

Do you want "robust standard errors"? P values calculated
according to some alternative logic?  Go ahead, calculate them in
your code, outreg will now accept them as arguments. As of Version
1.8.4, users can provide their own standard errors and/or p-values
for each model. Thus, if a model answers in the usual way to the
standard R request \code{coef(summary(model))}, outreg can work if
users supply standard errors.

About the customizations \code{request}.  The \code{request}
argument supplies a list of names of summary output elements that
are desired. The format is a pair, a value to be retrieved from
\code{summary(model)}, and a pretty name to be printed for
it. With the \code{lm()} regression, for example, one might want
the output of the F test and the adjusted R-square: Include
\code{request = c(adj.r.squared = "adj. $R^2$", "fstatistic" =
"F")}. The value on the left is the name of the desired
information in the summary object, while the value on the right is
\emph{any} valid LaTeX (or HTML) markup that the user desires to
display in the table. \code{request} terms that generate a single
numerical value will generally work fine, while requests that ask
for more structured information, such as the F test (including the
2 degrees of freedom values) may work (user feedback needed).

The \code{runFuns} argument is inspired by a user request: could
this include the BIC or other summaries that can be easily
calculated?  Any R function, such as \code{AIC} or \code{BIC},
should work, as long as it returns a single value.  This is a
two-part specification, a function name and a pretty label to be
used in printing. For example, \code{runFuns = c("AIC" = "Akaike
Criterion", "BIC" = "Schwartz Criterion", "logLik" = "LL")}.

About centering with dcolumn or siunitx. It appears now that
results are better with \code{siunitx} but \code{dcolumn} is more
familiar to users.  The user has the duty to make sure that the
document preamble includes the correct package,
\code{\\usepackage\{dcolumn\}} or \code{\\usepackage\{siunitx\}}.
In this version, I have eliminated the need for the user to
specify document-wide settings for \code{siunitx}. All of the
details are explicitly written in the header of each tabular.
It is done that way to more easily allow user customizations.

\note{
There are many R packages that can be used to create LaTeX
    regression tables. memisc, texreg, apsrtable, xtables, and rms
    are some. This "outreg" version was in use in our labs before
    we were aware that those packages were in development. It is
    not intended as a competitor, it is just a slightly different
    version of the same that is more suited to our needs.
