\name{cutByQuantile}
\alias{cutByQuantile}
\title{Calculates the "center" quantiles, always including the median, when n is odd.}
\usage{
cutByQuantile(x, n = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{n}{The number of quantile points. See details.}
}
\value{
A vector
}
\description{
If the numeric variable has fewer than 6 unique observed values,
this will send the data to \code{cutByTable}.  The default return
will find dividing points at three quantiles: c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75)
If n=4, the dividing points will be c(0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80) If
n=5, c(0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0) Larger n that are odd will
include 0.5 and evenly spaced points out to proportions 0 and
1.0. Larger n that is even will return evenly spaced points
calculated by R's \code{pretty} function.
