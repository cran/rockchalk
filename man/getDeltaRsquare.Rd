\title{Calculates the delta R-squares, also known as squared
semi-partial correlation coefficients.}
\usage{
  getDeltaRsquare(model)
}
\arguments{
  \item{model}{a fitted regression model}
}
\value{
  a vector of estimates of the delta R-squares
}
\description{
  The change in the R-square when a variable is removed
  from a regression is called delta R-square. It is
  sometimes suggested as a way to determine whether a
  variable has a substantial effect on an outcome. This is
  also known as the squared semi-partial correlation
  coefficient.

\examples{
dat1 <- genCorrelatedData(N=250, means=c(100,100),
sds=c(30,20), rho=0.0,  stde = 7, beta=c(1.1, 2.4, 4.1, 0))
m1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data=dat1)
getDeltaRsquare(m1)
## more problematic in presence of collinearity
dat2 <- genCorrelatedData(N=250, means=c(100,100),
sds=c(30,20), rho=0.6,  stde = 7, beta=c(1.1, 2.4, 4.1, 0))
m2 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data=dat2)
getDeltaRsquare(m2)
