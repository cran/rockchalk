	* examples/meanCenter-ex.R: remove references to centerContrasts

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): predict.mcreg centers all variable in the
	"centeredVars" list.
	* ../R/meanCenter.R: Cut "centerContrasts" option in meanCenter and tons of
	beautiful code because it is impossible to manage re-centering in
	predict.mcreg if there are centered congrasts. 

2012-03-03  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* examples/predict.rcreg-ex.R: new file to demo predict

	* ../R/residualCenter.R (predict.rcreg): new method handles
	by re-calcuating predictions for each auxiliary regression.

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): Found really bad bug where
	plotPlane(meanCenter) returned error about predict being
	used for wrong type of data. Problem traced back to fact
	that "scale" returns a matrix with 1 column, rather than
	a numeric vector, so dataClasses was mismatched.
	attr(,"dataClasses")
          y         xxx         x22
	"numeric" "nmatrix.1" "nmatrix.1".  The "newdata" I'd
	generate did not have "nmatrix.1" as the type, and so
	predict's use of .MFCheckClass resulted in failure.
	Like others, I say "How aggravating."

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): "std.dev." and "quantile" now
	legal strings for modxVals, along with particular values.

2012-01-30  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (plotPlane.default): correct typos referring to plotSlopes

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): add na.rm=TRUE for range commands

2012-01-25  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): change return value to include newdf

2012-01-09  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCformula): weird. data from residuals turns up
	with class "AsIs" and causes all kinds of confusion later
	* residualCenter now a generic method
	* residualCenter.default should work for any glm or lm.

2012-01-03  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): create class name for mean centered
	regression, add attributes.
	print.mcreg: new method

2011-12-30  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (carrier.name): use get_all_vars to build emf

2011-12-28  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R: insert plotPoints option to suppress plotting
	of points.  Question. Should plotPoints=FALSE force drawArrows=FALSE?

2011-12-12  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSeq.R: allow x to be a factor, return levels if so

	* /pauljohn.plotSeq.R (plotSeq): range
	allow missings

	* ../R/plotPlane.R: new introduced function

2011-12-11  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../DESCRIPTION (Date): Version: bump

	* ../R/perspEmpty.R (perspEmpty): range(na.rm=TRUE) allow missings

	* ../R/magRange.R (magRange): range(na.rm=TRUE) to allow missings

2011-12-06  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCformula): This is necessary so that all
	interactive components are included
	iv <- paste("(", gsub(":"," + ",x),")^2") 
	* Replace whole stucture to make sure x1.X.x2 coding gets used.

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): trying to fix that pesky "one
	extra variable" error in regression models

2011-12-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): fix problem when only one
	variable was left in calculating centralized predictor values. The
	bare vector has to be told "as.data.frame"

2011-12-01  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCresiduals): revised bug in calculation lmrc
	was not using residual centered variables when "x1:x2" was
	included, R was constructing own product term. So necessary to
	re-name the residual centered variable connector .X.

2011-11-26  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): added option drawArrows

2011-11-05  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): insert invisible() on returns

	* ../R/rockchalk-package.R: insert dataset religioncrime and
	documentation.
	* data/religioncrime.RData: new dataset with beautiful example
	of suppression

2011-11-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* rockchalk/rockchalk/R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): more fiddling
	with interaction

	* mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): fix interaction code in lm
